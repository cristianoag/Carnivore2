Last minute notes
-----------------

The default dual-slot functionality doesn't work on at least 2 computers: Sony HB-55 and HB-75. Please enable the "Slave Slot
as Master's Subslot" option to be able to run 2 ROMs at the same time on these computers. This also applies to certain Arabic
MSXs that have only one free available slot.

In some rare cases Carnivore2 may not work correctly. Such anomalous behavior has been spotted on at least 2 rare computers:
Mistubishi ML-G30 and Toshiba HX-34. If you have such computers and you are able to boot them with Carnivore2, please inform
the RBSC's coordinator.

When a computer is just powered on with the Carnivore2 cartridge inserted into a slot, it may reboot twice. This is normal and
was implemented to make sure that the cartridge is fully initialized after the cold boot. You can enable the Dual-Reset feature
in the Configuration settings.

When using Carnivore2 with National FS-4600F computer, always boot while holding the CTRL key. Otherwise some of Carnivore2
functiona may not work properly. It's unknown why this happens on this particular machine.
