The following versions of BIOSes are available:

\BIDECMFC.015	- Nextor 2.1.0 Release with IDE driver 0.1.5
\BIDECMFC.017	- Nextor 2.1.0 Release with IDE driver 0.1.7
\BIDECMFC.BIN	- Nextor 2.1.1 Beta 2 with IDE driver 0.1.7

If any of your CF cards or SD-to-CF adapters no longer work with Carnivore2, try to
replace the IDE bios with an alternative version. To do this, rename BIDECMFC.017 into
BIDECMFC.BIN and write the IDE BIOS into Carnivore2 with the C2MAN or C2MAN40 utility.
If you still have issues, do the same, but with BIDECMFC.015 file.

See the readme.txt file for more info.
