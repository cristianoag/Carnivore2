Carnivore2 MultiFunctional Cartridge

The power-up modification is no longer needed for the Carnivore2 cartridge starting
from version 2.30 (boot menu and firmware). The cartridge now detects the cold boot
and restarts a computer one more time to make sure that it's fully initialized.

If you made the power-up modification for your Carnivore2 cartridge, you can revert
it now and use the boot menu and firmware version 2.30 to mitigate the problem of
incomplete initialization on cold boot.
